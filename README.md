# 3d_objects

Random 3D objects that I create. Each object will have an explanatory paragraph here and will be in its own folder. I intend to keep openscad files, stl files and gcode files.

Most of these objects are done in Openscad and sliced via Cura.

## Double pipe clip

Clips 2 pipes together side by side

## Hex bits holder

A holder for hex screwdriver bits. I wanted to experiment with packing as dense as possible and also have them print as single wall objects (vase mode).
